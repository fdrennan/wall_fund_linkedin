# Table rows are stored in order in which they were obtained. 
# I am in Mexico currently so the times vs. amount will look a little off
# as I the times I stored in the data base working locally in Mexico are
# different from the CRON on AWS in OHIO. You can resolve the time difference if you like or 
# just use the values after ROW 32.
